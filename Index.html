                <p>I took this photo at a garden center when i was out 
                with my family. At the time we were learning to colour
                spot images so i made the background monochrome and
                the butterfly and flower retain their colour.</p>

                <p>I took this photograph on a pretty cloudy day. I used
                saturation tools to brighten up the sky. I really like
                how the clouds appear yellow because of the sunlight
                hitting them.

                <p>I took this photograph during a photoshoot after
                deciding to base my GCSE work on nature. I had fun
                editing with this photograph; I used masking and 
                colour spotting to make it look like the bird ate
                some berries.

                <p>I took this photograph on an icy day when everything
                had frosted over outside. I found a tiny mushroom among
                some moss a decided to take up a close up shot to capture
                all of the detail of the frost.

                <p>I took this photograph as everything began to defrost.
                this caused the forest to look glossy, this brought out 
                alot of highlights in the enviroment. I like how the 
                sunlight hits the water and makes it contrast the trees.

                <p>This photograph was submitted into a competition where
                it made it to the semi-finals. I am really happy that this
                photograph captures all the deatails of the robin's
                feathers.

                <p>During the winter the sunsets can appear really orange
                so i decided to edit a sunset with the silhouettes of
                trees in the foreground. My goal with the edit was to
                bring out the warm colours of the sunset.

                <p>When i went to beach there was some sea foam on the
                shore. i decided to take a photograph of it at eye level.
                The foam reminds me of a little island in the photograph.
